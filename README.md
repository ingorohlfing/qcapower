## Estimating power and required sample size in QCA
The `qcapower` package for R allows researchers working with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to 

* estimate power using permutation tests and create diagnostic plots;
* estimate the required sample size for a target power level.

Version 0.1.0 of the package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qcapower). Please read the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qcapower/vignettes/Introduction.html) for information on what you can do with the package.

```r
install.packages("qcapower")
library(qcapower)
```

The current version can be installed from Github. As of today, it is the same as the version on CRAN.

```r
devtools::install_github("ingorohlfing/qcapower")
library(qcapower)
```
