## Estimating power and required sample size in QCA
The `qcapower` package for R allows researchers working with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to 

* estimate power using permutation tests and create diagnostic plots;
* estimate the required sample size for a target power level.

Please see the [vignette](./vignettes/Introduction.Rmd) for more information on the package. The current development version can be installed from Github.

```r
devtools::install_github("ingorohlfing/qcapower")
library(qcapower)
```
