Description: The package allows users to estimate power of a sufficient term
    using permutation tests. A term can be anything: A condition, conjunction or 
    disjunction of any combination of these. The package further allows users to plot 
    the estimation results and to estimate the number of cases required to achieve a
    certain level of power, given a prespecified null and alternative hypothesis.
