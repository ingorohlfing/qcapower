Description: The package allows you to estimate power of a term in a truth table
    analysis. A term can be anything: a condition, conjunction or disjunction of any
    of these. For ex ante power estimation, you need a consistency score, the number
    of cases, an alternative hypothesis about the actual consistency score of the
    term and a null hypothesis about a consistency score separating consistent from
    inconsistent terms.
